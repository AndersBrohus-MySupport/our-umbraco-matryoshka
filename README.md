Matryoshka enables you to layer your document type properties in tabs and groups. It substitutes the content editor view, with its own view, to make existing groups appear as tabs, and adds a property editor, which gives the impression of groups.


## Getting Started

### Installation

> *Note:* Matryoshka has been developed against **Umbraco v8.4.0** and will support that version and above. It should work in v.8.0 and above too though.

Matryoshka can be installed from Our Umbraco package repository.

#### Our Umbraco package repository

To install from Our Umbraco, please download the package from:

## Developers Guide

When installed, Matryoshka will change all your existing groups, to be shown as tabs. You can't switch between tabs/groups.

For faux group separations. You can add a datatype using the Matryoshka Group Separator property editor included in the package. When used, the separator will display the property name and description as a headline for your new faux group.
